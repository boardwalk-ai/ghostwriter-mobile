# GhostWriter backend contract

Status: **draft for approval** — nothing here is built yet.

This is the agreement between the GhostWriter mobile app and its new Rust
backend: what is stored, which endpoints exist, and which events the app
receives. It replaces the Go + Python backend copied from Cockpit PR #18.

## 1. Decisions already made

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Language | Rust (axum + sqlx + tokio), same stack as the other Octopilot Rust services |
| Where the code lives | This repo, under `backend/`. Not in the Cockpit workspace. |
| Database | Postgres only, in its own database (`ghostwriter`). No Scylla for now. |
| Relation to Doc Oct | None at the data level. GhostWriter projects are not Doc Oct documents. Only the editor **code** is shared. |
| Saving | Same mechanism as Doc Oct: the client picks the id up front, saves are idempotent upserts, autosave. |
| Who writes the document | The agent, on the server. The document lives on the server. |
| Editing while the agent writes | Not allowed. The document is locked; the editor is read-only. |
| What the chat shows while writing | A word-count progress bar (`320 / 800 words`), not the essay text. |
| Live text | Letter by letter, but only to a client that has the editor open. |
| Revisions | The agent re-reads the whole essay and rewrites what was asked. A version is saved before every agent edit so it can be undone. |
| Formatting | Semantic fields + body are stored; the Doc Oct formatters lay them out. |
| Notifications | Push when a question is waiting; Live Activities / ongoing notification for progress. Last phase. |

## 2. Layout

```
backend/
  Cargo.toml                 workspace
  crates/
    ghostwriter-api/         the service
      src/
        main.rs  config.rs  routes/  agent/  tools/  store/  stream.rs
      migrations/            sqlx migrations for the `ghostwriter` database
    octo-common/             auth, credits, identity, OpenRouter client
  Dockerfile
```

`octo-common` is copied from the Cockpit Rust workspace (branch
`feat/octonotes-backend`, which is not on GitHub). See open point 9.2.

Two connection pools, the same split OctoNotes uses:

- **`ghostwriter` database** — everything in section 3.
- **shared `octopilot` database** — read `users`, `api_keys`,
  `system_settings`; charge OctoCredits. GhostWriter never creates tables there.

## 3. Database (`ghostwriter`)

```sql
-- A project is one essay: its brief, its document, its runs.
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id            uuid PRIMARY KEY,          -- chosen by the client
  user_id       uuid NOT NULL,             -- users.id in the octopilot DB
  folder_id     uuid REFERENCES folders(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  title         text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Untitled essay',
  instruction   text NOT NULL DEFAULT '',  -- the brief the user typed
  status        text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'idle',  -- idle | writing | ready
  target_words  int,
  word_count    int  NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at    timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at    timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX projects_user_updated ON projects (user_id, updated_at DESC);

CREATE TABLE folders (
  id         uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id    uuid NOT NULL,
  name       text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- The one live document per project. `rev` goes up by one on every change.
CREATE TABLE documents (
  project_id     uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  rev            bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  style          text   NOT NULL DEFAULT 'apa',   -- apa | mla | chicago | harvard | ieee | none
  title          text   NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  fields         jsonb  NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',    -- studentName, institutionName, courseName, instructorName, date
  body           text   NOT NULL DEFAULT '',      -- plain text, paragraphs separated by a blank line
  delta          jsonb,                           -- rich body (Quill delta) once the user has edited
  bibliography   text   NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  sources        jsonb  NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',
  locked_by_run  uuid,                            -- set while the agent is writing
  updated_at     timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Snapshot taken before the agent changes the document, and on user saves.
CREATE TABLE document_versions (
  id          uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  project_id  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  rev         bigint NOT NULL,
  reason      text   NOT NULL,   -- agent_write | agent_revise | humanize | user_save | restore
  snapshot    jsonb  NOT NULL,   -- the whole document row at that rev
  created_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX document_versions_project ON document_versions (project_id, rev DESC);

-- One agent run. Everything needed to resume after a restart is here.
CREATE TABLE runs (
  id                uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id        uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id           uuid NOT NULL,
  status            text NOT NULL,   -- running | waiting_for_user | finished | error | cancelled
  context           jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',   -- plan, outlines, sources, settings
  messages          jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',   -- the orchestrator's chat history
  pending_question  jsonb,
  last_seq          bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  error             text,
  created_at        timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at        timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX runs_one_active_per_project
  ON runs (project_id) WHERE status IN ('running', 'waiting_for_user');

-- Durable event log. The app replays it to rebuild the timeline.
CREATE TABLE run_events (
  run_id      uuid   NOT NULL REFERENCES runs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  seq         bigint NOT NULL,
  type        text   NOT NULL,
  payload     jsonb  NOT NULL,
  created_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (run_id, seq)
);
```

`run_events` is kept as its own table with a simple `(run_id, seq)` key so it
can move to another store later without touching anything else.

## 4. Auth

Every request carries `Authorization: Bearer <Firebase ID token>` (project
`octopilot-ai-7b29e`). The token's UID is mapped to `users.id`. With no Firebase
project configured (local dev) the `X-User-Id` header is trusted instead.

Every project, run and document is checked against the caller's `user_id`.

## 5. Endpoints

All under `/v1`. JSON in, JSON out, camelCase.

### Account

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/me` | `{ id, name, email, photoUrl, octoCredits }` |

### Projects and folders

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/projects` | The user's projects, newest first, plus folders |
| PUT | `/projects/:id` | Create or update (idempotent): `{ title?, folderId?, instruction? }` |
| GET | `/projects/:id` | One project, with `activeRunId` if a run is in progress |
| DELETE | `/projects/:id` | Delete a project and everything under it |
| PUT | `/folders/:id` | Create or rename: `{ name }` |
| DELETE | `/folders/:id` | Delete a folder (projects are kept, unfiled) |

### Runs

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/projects/:id/runs` | Start a run: `{ runId, instruction }` → `{ runId }`. Same `runId` twice is a no-op. 409 if a run is already active. |
| GET | `/runs/:runId/events?sinceSeq=N` | Server-Sent Events (section 6). Replays stored events after `N`, then stays live. |
| POST | `/runs/:runId/answer` | `{ field, value }` — answers the pending question. 409 if that question is not pending. |
| POST | `/runs/:runId/message` | `{ text }` — a free chat message to the agent |
| POST | `/runs/:runId/cancel` | Stop the run and release the document lock |

A run keeps going when the app disconnects. The app reconnects with the last
`seq` it saw and misses nothing.

### Document

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/projects/:id/document` | The document, its `rev`, and `locked` |
| PUT | `/projects/:id/document` | Save from the editor: `{ baseRev, style, title, fields, body, delta }`. **409** while locked, **409** if `baseRev` is stale. |
| GET | `/projects/:id/document/stream` | SSE for the read-only editor (section 7) |
| GET | `/projects/:id/versions` | Version list |
| POST | `/projects/:id/versions/:versionId/restore` | Roll the document back (undo an agent edit) |

## 6. Run events

Each SSE frame carries `id: <seq>` and `data: <json>`. `seq` starts at 1 and
never repeats within a run. A keep-alive comment is sent every 15 seconds.

Stored and replayed:

| Type | Payload | Shown as |
|---|---|---|
| `user_message` | `text` | User bubble |
| `assistant_message` | `text` | GhostWriter bubble |
| `step_start` | `stepId, tool, title` | A step card, running |
| `step_progress` | `stepId, detail` | Detail line on that card |
| `step_done` | `stepId, summary?` | Card turns to done |
| `step_error` | `stepId, error, retryable` | Card turns to failed |
| `thought` | `stepId?, text` | The agent's short reasoning, attached to the step |
| `question` | see 6.1 | A question card |
| `question_answered` | `field, value` | Question card collapses to the answer |
| `sources_ready` | `count` | **Sources pill appears** |
| `writing_started` | `targetWords` | **Open Editor pill appears**; progress bar starts |
| `write_progress` | `words, targetWords` | Progress bar. At most one per second. `words` may exceed `targetWords`. |
| `document_updated` | `rev, wordCount` | Editor refetches if it is open and not streaming |
| `credits` | `charged, balance, reason` | OctoCredits pill counts down |
| `done` | — | Run finished; document unlocked |
| `fatal` | `error` | Run failed; document unlocked |

Sent live but **not** stored: `assistant_delta { chunk }`, so GhostWriter's
replies type out. On replay the app gets the finished `assistant_message` only.

### 6.1 Questions

```json
{
  "type": "question",
  "field": "citationStyle",
  "question": "Which citation format?",
  "inputType": "select",
  "options": [{ "label": "APA", "value": "APA" }],
  "allowCustom": false,
  "sources": []
}
```

| `inputType` | Control | Answer value |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | Text field | string |
| `number` | Number field + chips | number |
| `select` | Chips, one choice | string |
| `multiselect` | Checkboxes + "Suggest more" + custom | array of strings, or `"__suggest_more__"` |
| `sourceReview` | Source review sheet | array of `{ url, focusNote?, rejected? }` |

Fields, in the order the agent asks them:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `essayFocus` | multiselect | Options come from the plan |
| `sourceReviewChoice` | select | `Review Sources` / `One Shot` (phase 4) |
| `sourceReview` | sourceReview | Only after `Review Sources` (phase 4) |
| `wordCount` | number | Chips 500 / 800 / 1200 / 2000 / 3000 |
| `citationStyle` | select | APA / MLA / Chicago / Harvard / IEEE / None |
| `studentName`, `instructorName`, `institutionName`, `courseInfo`, `essayDate` | text | Only the ones the chosen style needs |
| `humanizerChoice` | select | StealthGPT / UndetectableAI / Skip (phase 4) |
| `paragraphSplitChoice` | select | After StealthGPT only (phase 4) |

A chat message sent while `essayFocus` is pending is treated as a direction for
new focus options, as on the web.

## 7. The document and the lock

1. When `write_essay` starts, the run takes the lock (`locked_by_run`), saves a
   version, and emits `writing_started`.
2. The writer streams from the model. The server keeps the text in memory,
   counts words, and emits `write_progress` once a second.
3. The text is saved to `documents` at the end of each paragraph (and at least
   every 2 seconds), bumping `rev` and emitting `document_updated`.
4. When writing ends the lock is released. From then on the editor can save.
5. A revision takes the lock again, saves a version, rewrites, and releases.

The lock is enforced on the server: a `PUT /document` during a write gets 409.

### Live text for the read-only editor

`GET /projects/:id/document/stream`:

| Event | Payload | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `snapshot` | the whole document + `rev` + `locked` | Sent first |
| `delta` | `text` | Characters to append to the body. Batched about every 50 ms. |
| `committed` | `rev` | The text so far is saved |
| `unlocked` | `rev` | The agent is done; the editor may become editable |

Text is only pushed to clients connected to this stream, so a chat-only client
costs nothing extra.

The writer is prompted to produce the body paragraphs only. The bibliography is
produced as a separate step, so the stream is clean prose.

## 8. Credits

OctoCredits are charged through the shared ledger (`octo-common::credits`),
idempotent on `ghostwriter:<action>:<runId>[:n]`:

| Action | When | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Source search | After `search_sources` succeeds | per the pricing table |
| Essay generation | After `write_essay` succeeds | by words written, per the pricing table |
| Humanize | After `humanize_essay` succeeds | by words, per the pricing table |

The balance is pre-checked before each paid step. If it is too low the step
fails with a clear message and the run waits for the user rather than dying.

## 9. Open points

1. **Pricing numbers.** The web charges a minimum of 100 OC per operation from
   `pricing.py` on the FastAPI backend. The Rust service needs the same table.
2. **`octo-common`.** It lives on an unpushed Cockpit branch. The plan is to copy
   it into this repo. If the Cockpit branch is pushed later, this can become a
   git dependency instead of a copy.
3. **Firebase on mobile.** The app needs its own Android and iOS apps registered
   in the Firebase project (package `ai.boardwalk.ghostwriter`) to get
   `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist`.
4. **Deployment.** Docker container on the VPS behind nginx. Port and public path
   to be picked against the server's current port map.
5. **Models and keys.** Read from the shared DB (`api_keys`, `system_settings`):
   primary model for the orchestrator and writer, secondary for outlines,
   source-search model for search.

## 10. Build order

| Phase | Scope |
|---|---|
| 1a | Service skeleton, migrations, auth, `/me`, projects and folders |
| 1b | Runs: start, durable events, SSE with replay, answer, message, cancel |
| 1c | Agent loop + core tools: plan, focus question, outlines, search, scrape, compact, word count and citation questions, write, formatting questions |
| 1d | Document: lock, versions, save, live stream, word-count progress |
| 2 | Mobile chat: timeline, question cards, progress bar, pills |
| 3 | Editor: shared core from `doc_oct`, mobile editor, read-only live text |
| 4 | Revision mode, source review, humanizer |
| 5 | Push notifications, Live Activities, Android ongoing notification |
